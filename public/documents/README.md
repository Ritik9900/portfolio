Place your PDF documents here to display them in your portfolio.

## Required Files:

1. **resume.pdf** - Your resume/CV
2. **degree.pdf** - Your degree certificate
3. **minor1.pdf** - Your first minor certificate
4. **minor2.pdf** - Your second minor certificate

## Important Notes:

- All files should be in PDF format
- The PDFs will be displayed in a modal viewer
- Download option is disabled for viewers (view-only)
- Maximum recommended file size: 5MB per PDF
- Make sure the file names match exactly as listed above

## Adding Your PDFs:

1. Save your PDF files with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in this folder: `public/documents/`
3. The website will automatically load them when users click to view

## Privacy & Security:

- PDFs are served from your GitHub Pages site
- Users can view but downloading is discouraged through the viewer settings
- Note: Technically savvy users can still download if they inspect the network requests
- For true protection, consider watermarking your documents

## Testing Locally:

When running `npm run dev`, make sure your PDFs are in place to test the functionality.
